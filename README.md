### Project Description
[This project introduces a web application designed to streamline the seat allotment process for students, eliminating the need to check physical notice boards. The application includes robust user management, allowing administrators to upload classroom and student data efficiently. It generates seating plans automatically and notifies students of their assigned seats via email. The notification system supports both scheduled updates and real-time emergency alerts, ensuring timely communication. Additional features include a background scheduler for automated tasks, data export capabilities for records, and a user-friendly interface to enhance accessibility and convenience for students and administrators alike.]

### The Problem statement
[In educational institutions, the manual process of allocating and notifying students about their seating arrangements often leads to inefficiencies, overcrowding at notice boards, delays in communication, and increased administrative workload. This traditional approach is prone to errors, lacks real-time updates, and does not cater to emergency situations effectively. There is a need for a more efficient, automated, and accessible system to manage seating allocations and communicate updates directly to students in a timely manner.]

### The Solution
[A web-based application automates seat allocation and notifies students via email, eliminating physical notice boards. It includes user management, bulk data upload, automated seating plans, scheduled and emergency notifications, background task automation, and data export. This solution ensures efficient communication, reduces overcrowding, and streamlines administrative tasks.]
